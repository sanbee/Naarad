1. Change ATT88 pix 18,17 connection to RFM69CW:  ATT88-18, -17 --> RFM64-8, -5.

      ATT88 Physical Pin                       RFM69CW Pins
            16 (SS)                              7 (NSS)
            17 (MOSI)                            5 (MOSI)
            18 (MISO)                            8 (MISO)
            19 SCK                               6 (SCK)
             4 (INT0/2/PCINT18/PD2)              9 DI00


2. Pull-up RFM69CW pin 7 to allow in-circuit programming of the MCU.  
   A 10K resistor across Pin-2 (VCC) and -7.

3. Mark input pins/ports

4. Mark output ports

5. Increase font size

6. Mounting holes

7. IC pin labels in the bottom layer.

8. Add MCU programming port

9. Measure 9V

10. Port to add temp, humidity sensors.

11. Solenoid ports are connected as
      +|-  -|+  +|-  -|+

    Re-route them to be
      -|+  -|+  -|+  -|+

12. Fix the circuit issue that prevents
    common ground for all solenoid ports.
    This will require 7 wires for all 6 ports
    (as against 12 required currently).
