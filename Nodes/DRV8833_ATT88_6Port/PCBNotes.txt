1. Fix the connections to RFM69CW module

   The following connections have been tested to work on breadboard:

    ATT88 Physical Pin              RFM69CW Pins
       16 (SS)                        7 (NSS)
       17 (MOSI)                      5 (MOSI)
       18 (MISO)                      8 (MISO)
       19 (SCK)                       6 (SCK)
        4 (INT0/2/PCINT18/PD2)        9 (DI00)

    On the PCB the connections are
       17 (MOSI)                      8 (MISO)
       18 (MISO)                      5 (MOSI)


2. ATT88 cannot be programmed when connected to RFM69CW module.
   Needs a jumper.

   This is because ATT88 pin 16 (SS) is also connected the RFM69CW's pin 7(NSS).  When
   programming ATT88 from UNO, pin 16 is pulled low to select ATT88 over SPI.  This then
   also selects RFM69.  Since on one device can be active at a time on SPI, the
   programming fails.

   Solution:  Disconnect RFM69CW pin 7 and pull it high so that it's MOSI/MISO in-system
   connections are effectively disabled.  ATT88 can then be programmed.

3. Mark the port output pins and ports.

4. Increase font size.

5. Slightly larger mounting holes

6. Figure out putting labels on the bottom layer.  In particular IC pin labels.

7. Add a port with MCU pins for easier programming.
     Pins 1,16,17,18,19
