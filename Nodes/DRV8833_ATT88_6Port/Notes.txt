o With the default set up on ArduinoIDE 1.8.x, "Arduino as ISP" did not detect ATT88.
  After some reasearch, it turned out that the compile command constructed uses
  "-carduino".  However the correct one to use, on Arduino UNO for programming ATT88 is
  "-cstk500v1".  

  Arduino IDE comes with a file named "programmer.txt", typically at the following path:

     ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.6.23/programmers.txt

     (1.6.23 may change with the IDE version used)

  It also exists at 

     <IDE ROOT>/hardware/arduino/avr/programmers.txt

  The entry in these files (may need to change both!) for "arduinoasisp" has to be the
  following.  Note that the ".protocol" value has to change to "stk500v1".
  ".program.protocol=arduino" is left unchanged

    arduinoasisp.name=Arduino as ISP
    arduinoasisp.communication=serial
    arduinoasisp.protocol=stk500v1
    arduinoasisp.speed=19200
    arduinoasisp.program.protocol=arduino
    arduinoasisp.program.speed=19200
    arduinoasisp.program.tool=avrdude
    arduinoasisp.program.extra_params=-P{serial.port} -b{program.speed}

  Some forums seems to suggest that this will be fixed in the new release which it's out
  yet.  I have checked the nightly build and it's not fixed in at least that.

  Apparently this is due to some change in OS (Linux) that requires this change.  I also
  feel there much be some OS related change since I have successfully programmed ATT88
  *without* needing the above change from the same machine (work laptop) running RHFL6.
  Now with RHEL7, the above problem appears.

  Also, this change was made in Arduino IDE to enable programming ATMega chips (or
  something similar), but it inadvertently, created the above problem. 


  For the record, the compile command that works is:

   /export/home/langur/sbhatnag/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino14/bin/avrdude -C/export/home/langur/sbhatnag/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino14/etc/avrdude.conf -v -pattiny88 -cstk500v1 -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b19200 -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_738819/DRV8833_ATT88_6Port.ino.hex:i
